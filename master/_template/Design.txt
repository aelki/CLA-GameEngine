CLA Game Engine Design


===== Naming Conventions
- nameThis - Dedicated for internal variables
- name_this - Dedicated to settings function,
			  specifically the ones you can alter in-code.
- NameThis - I have no idea.
- 

===== Naming Conventions based on needs
- arguments
- variables

===== Main.cpp
- Contains Game class object for run loop initialization.
- Contains test functions for debugging purposes without using Game loop.

===== Game.h
- Contains game loop for running the game.
- Contains initialization for the following:
	- sf::RenderWindow
	- (x) Event (excluded to be moved to SceneManager)
	- sf::Clock, sf::Time
	- StateManager for managing state.
		- GameState manager should contain:
			- Init() or OnEntry()
			- Cleanup() or OnExit()
			- Pause(), Resume()
			- HandleEvents(), Update(), Draw()
		- Game class needs the following function.
			- ChangeState(GameState* state)
			- PushState(GameState state)
			- PopState()
		- Who uses or calls these State functions?
			- When player interacts with something (Scene/ECS)
			- When player presses a button in-game (ECS?)
			- When an event happens (Scene)
	- ActiveWindow
		- There is only one window per game. Global Variable is okay.
		- Contains sf::RenderWindow* window and bool is_running.
	- Keys
		- Key Inputs to be applied to all derived keybinds.
	- Debugs
		- Special Init that can't be done in other inits or run loops.
- Main Functions
	- update(dt)
	- render()
